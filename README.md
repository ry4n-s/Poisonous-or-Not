# Poisonous-or-Not

An AI model that can differentiate between posionous and non-poisonous snakes.

This uses the fastai library in Python. Using web searches, the AI trains itself to detect whether a snake is poisonous or not. 

A program like this could have very useful real-world applications. Suppose you are a hiker and get bitten by a snake. After, you take a photo of the snake that bit you. Now you could be able to use this AI model to tell you with relative certainty if the snake that bit you was poisonous or not. From that you learn if you require urgent care or if you're fine.
